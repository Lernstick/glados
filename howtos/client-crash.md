## Client crashes during exam

If a client has a crash during the exam, you can just restart the machine with an USB-Stick as described in [Taking an Exam](take-exam.md). Just follow the same steps and you will find the system in the state of the latest backup. **You don't need to manually restore anything**, it will automatically do this itself, while preparing the exam. You may see the restore indicated in the progress bar.

Depending on the *Backup Interval* (see [Create a single ticket](create-single-ticket.md)), the lost work will be at most once that interval plus the last time the work was saved.
