## Client crashes during exam

If a client has a crash during the exam, you can just restart the machine with an USB-Stick as described in [Taking an Exam](take-exam.md). Just follow the same steps and the system will be in the state of the latest backup. You don't need to manually restore anything, it will automatically do this itself while preparing the exam. You may see this in the progress bar.

Depending on the backup interval, the lost work will be at most once that interval plus the last time the work was saved.
