This page describes how to take an exam as a testee.

The first step is to boot the computer from USB. See the following instructions:
* [Start from USB-Device (Mac)](https://wiki.lernstick.ch/doku.php?id=anleitungen:systemstart-mac)
* [Start from USB-Device (Windows 10)](https://wiki.lernstick.ch/doku.php?id=anleitungen:systemstart-uefi)

As soon as the system has started and you have a working network connection, your can search for the exam server.

If the search was successful, you will be prompted for approval. If you approve, you will be prompted for a token. This is the token from the exam sheet (See [Create a single ticket](create-single-ticket.md)).

To finish the exam double-click the `Finish exam` icon on the desktop. You should **save all your work** before doing this. **This is not reversible!**
