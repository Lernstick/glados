## Taking an Exam

This page describes how to take an exam from the perspective of a student.

The first step is to boot [Lernstick Pr√ºfungsumgebung](https://www.imedias.ch/themen/lernstick/index.cfm) on your computer from USB. See the following instructions on how to boot your device from USB:

* [Start from USB-Device (Mac)](https://wiki.lernstick.ch/doku.php?id=anleitungen:systemstart-mac)
* [Start from USB-Device (Windows 10)](https://wiki.lernstick.ch/doku.php?id=anleitungen:systemstart-uefi)

As soon as the system has started and you have a working network connection, your can search for the exam server by starting the `Search Exam Server` application.

If the search was successful, you will be prompted for approval. You will then be prompted for a token. This is the token given on the exam sheet (See [Create a single ticket](create-single-ticket.md)).

If your provided a valid token, the download and preparation of the exam is done and after a while (depending on the size of the exam files) you will see this:

Press `Yes` and the system will immediately restart into the exam (this will take a moment). Finally you will see a desktop and the message below.

To finish the exam click the `Finish exam` icon in the "favorite applications" dash. You should **save all your work** before doing this. **This is not reversible!**

This will initiate the last backup of all exam files and marks your exam as finished (See [Ticket states](ticket-states.md)). You will get a notice when the last backup is done, **don't shutdown your computer** before the request message appears. Changes of the exam result from now on, will not be saved.
