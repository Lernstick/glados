## System Settings

There are currently a few global configuration settings that can be modified by the user. The interface to edit settings can be reached via `System->Settings` if you have the permission to do so.

When editing an item, you can either reset the value to its default value that is given in the view, or change it freely as you wish. The right hand side of the view will give you a preview of the change if you apply them (if possible). Some settings will only accept numbers in a given range and you will not be able to provide wrong input.
