## Create an exam

To start the exam creation, navigate to `Actions->Create Exam`. In the appearing wizard, you have to provide some information about the exam.

The *Name* and *Subject* fields are to identify the exam. The *Name* may not be unique, but it is not recommended to create multiple exams with the same name for reasons of clarity.

You can set a *Time Limit* (in minutes). Notice that this can also be set in the [ticket](create-single-ticket.md) and the value in the ticket will override this one.

For more information about the *Remote Backup Path*, please visit [this page](remote-backup-path.md).

There are multiple settings in the *Settings* tab. You can add new settings by clicking the *Add Setting* button. Choose the setting you want to add from the appearing list by clicking on it. You will now have the possibility to adjust (various) subsettings for the chosen setting. For more informations about the settings, please refer to the information given by clicking the ![questionmarks](img/questionmark.png) aside.

> For the *Screen capturing* setting, please read [Screen Capturing](screen-capturing.md).

When clicking `Next Step`, a new field called *Exam File* will appear. Here you have to provide an image file holding the information for the exam. Please read the following sections on how to create this file:

* [Create a zip-file as exam file](create-zip-exam-file.md)
* [Create a squashfs-filesystem as exam file](create-squashfs-exam-file.md)
