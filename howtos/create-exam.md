## Create an exam

To start the exam creation, navigate to `Actions->Create Exam`. In the appearing wizard, you have to provide some information about the exam.

The *Name* and *Subject* fields are to identify the exam. The *Name* may not be unique, but it is not recommended to create multiple exams with the same name for reasons of clarity.

You can set a *Time Limit* (in minutes). Notice that this can also be set in the [ticket](create-single-ticket.md) and the value in the ticket will override this one.

For more information about the *Remote Backup Path*, please visit [this page](remote-backup-path.md).

For then options in the *General* and the *Libreoffice* tab, please read the information given, when clicking the ![Questionmark](img/questionmark.png) aside.

When clicking `Next Step`, a new field called *Exam File* will appear. Here you have to provide an image file holding the information for the exam. Please read the following sections on how to create this file:

* [Create a zip-file as exam file](create-zip-exam-file.md)
* [Create a squashfs-filesystem as exam file](create-squashfs-exam-file.md)
